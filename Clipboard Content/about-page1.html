    <b>Hey there, I'm Andy.</b><br></br>
    I've been programming, drawing, and designing projects since I got my first computer at age 12.
    I still remember sitting down to install python for the first time, diving into Youtube tutorials, and ambitiously deciding that tackling natural language processing would be my first project.
    <i>Needless to say</i>... 12-year-old me wasn't quite ready for that challenge.
    But that moment sparked a passion and excitement for learning and creating that has followed me untill this day.
