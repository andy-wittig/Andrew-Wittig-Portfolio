    I'm currently attending my last year at the University of Nevada Reno, pursuing my bachelors degree in Computer Science and Engineering.
    I love researching graphics technologies, pushing my creative abilities through project development, and working hard to achieve my aspirations of launching my career in Engineering.
    I'm passionate and dedicated towards my work and I'm a strong team player who brings enthusiasm and a positive attitude for problem-solving to every project I work on.
