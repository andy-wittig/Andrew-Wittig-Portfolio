    This space simulation is a C++ project built using the OpenGL rendering pipeline to display complex 3D models with lighting and texturing.
    This project garnered valuable experience with the GLSL shader language, matrix mathematics, graphics engine development, and API integration with libraries such as Assimp (model loading) and STB Image (texture processing).
    <br>
    The interactable model of the solar system includes both planetary orbit mode and a first-person flight mode to enhance exploration. To enhance the graphical fidelity, the project incorporates bloom and HDR buffers, normal mapping, and emissive lighting maps.
    To boost the runtime performance, object instancing was implemented to efficiently render asteroid belts.
