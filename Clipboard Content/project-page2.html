    This <a href="https://strangefew.itch.io/deadhelm-demo" target="_blank">project</a> was developed over the course of a year, with all art, game design, programming, audio, and system design created independently.
    The original soundtrack was generously contributed by a close friend.
    Built using GDScript in the Godot engine, this game features a custom inventory management system, saving/loading functionality via file management, a modular animation system, complex state-machines for character interaction and physics control,
    and object-oriented programming for reusable, maintainable game logic--especially for enemy behavior and interaction.
    This game also includes a fully functional user interface designed to assist user experience, supporting menu navigation, control remapping, graphical and audio adjustments, and live tracking of in-game statistics.
