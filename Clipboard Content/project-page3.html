        <b><u>WebGL Physically Based Rendering</b></u>
    </div>
    This portfolio website is run using WebGL 2.0!
    While higher-level APIs are avaiable like Three.js to easily construct 3D scenes, I instead chose to challenge myself by powering this website with custom a graphics engine using only WebGL.
    The first problem to overcome was loading 3D model file data. To solve this, I wrote a custom .obj parser that formats object data in a way compatible with the WebGL pipeline.
    After a model is loaded its assigned to physically based rendering (PBR) texture maps to simulate realistic lighting and surface details.
    I created all the models in Blender and baked their corresponding textures for use in the engine.
    To simulate ambient lighting on object surfaces, HDR images are used to generate irradiance maps and Look up Tables (LUTs) that dynamically adjust lighting and reflections based on the surrounding environment.
    By converting world coordinates to screen space, HTML elements are overlaid and tracked onto 3D objects to populate the sites content.
    The background image on the home page is also generated using WebGL. I implemented Perlin noise generation with shaders and rendered it to a background quad. 
    This produced a dynamic and animated page background that enhances the sites visual interest. Repository linked <a href="https://github.com/andy-wittig/Andrew-Wittig-Portfolio" target="_blank">here!</a>
